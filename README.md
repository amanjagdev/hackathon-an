### Getting Started- Local installation guide:

The following section will take you through the steps of setting up this app and getting it running locally on your computer.
## 1. Clone the repository
The first step is to clone the project repository to a local directory on your computer. To clone the repository, run the following command:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/amanjagdev/stockify.git</pre>

## 2. Install Node.js
If you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can install the latest version <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a>.

## 3. Install yarn 
To be able to install the dependencies and start the application locally, you will need to install yarn. Yarn is a package manager like npm.
To install yarn, run the following command:
<pre>npm install -g yarn</pre>
For more information about yarn and other installation options, see the yarn documentation: https://yarnpkg.com/en/.

## 4. Install the project dependencies.
Version information for each of these packages is available in the package.json file in the project root directory and in the client directory.

After you clone the repository to a local directory, change directory to the project root directory and run the following command to install the required packages:

<pre>yarn install</pre>

## 5. Install MongoDB.

## 6. Start the Express server and React development server.
After performing all of the setup steps in the Getting started section, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to start the Express server and React development server.

<pre>yarn start</pre>

After the development server has started, a Chrome browser window should open, and you should see the login screen for the application. If the browser does not automatically open after the server starts, you can verify that the application is working locally on your computer by opening Chrome and going to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.
